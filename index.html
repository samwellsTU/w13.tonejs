      Load Tone.js from a CDN (unpkg).
      This library enables audio synthesis and scheduling in the browser.
      It will be available globally as `Tone`.

    <!--
      Load our custom logic in an ES module file.
      This script (toneExample.js) contains the JavaScript that interacts with Tone.js
      and responds to user interaction (i.e., button press).

    <!--
      Button to trigger Tone.js example.
      The associated script sets up synths and loops that start when this button is clicked.
      (Tone.js requires user interaction to start the AudioContext due to browser security.)
